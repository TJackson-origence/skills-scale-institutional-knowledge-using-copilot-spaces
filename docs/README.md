## How to Use These Docs

- **For Project Managers**: Use the lifecycle guides to plan and execute projects, and the risk/communication guide to keep stakeholders informed.
- **For Product Managers**: Start with the Project Management Overview, then reference the Initiation and Planning guides for defining scope and success metrics.
- **For Developers & Teams**: Review the Execution & Tracking guide for workflow standards, and the Release & Deployment guide for release processes.
- **For Copilot Spaces**: Add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` if you want Copilot to use them as context for guidance and recommendations.

## Key Principles

OctoAcme projects are guided by these core principles:
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named PM and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning
